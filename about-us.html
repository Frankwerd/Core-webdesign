                    <h2>Our History</h2>
                    <p>Founded in 2018, CORESSWC emerged from a shared vision among a group of passionate financial professionals and community leaders. Recognizing the critical need for accessible financial education, they set out to create an organization that would bridge the gap between financial knowledge and practical application. Initially, CORESSWC focused on offering free workshops and seminars in local community centers, covering topics such as budgeting, debt management, and investing. As demand grew, the organization expanded its reach through online resources, personalized coaching, and partnerships with schools and businesses. Today, CORESSWC continues to evolve, adapting its programs to meet the changing needs of the communities it serves, while remaining steadfast in its commitment to financial empowerment.</p>
